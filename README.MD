[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) ![This script was last tested in Nuix 9.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/Script%20Tested%20in%20Nuix-9.0-green.svg)

View the GitHub project [here](https://github.com/Nuix/Export-Mime-Type-Settings) or download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Nuix/Export-Mime-Type-Settings/releases).

# Overview

Scrapes mime type settings from batch load details present in a Nuix case.  Output could be used to configure mime type settings in a new ingestion performed via the API or output could be informative.

# Getting Started

## Setup

Begin by downloading the latest release of this code.  Extract the contents of the archive into your Nuix scripts directory.  In Windows the script directory is likely going to be either of the following:

- `%appdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - User level script directory
- `%programdata%\Nuix\Scripts` - System level script directory

# Usage

Choose an output directory and whether you want JSON files, CSV files or both.  Files are named after the ID of each batch load in the current case.

# Cloning this Repository

This script relies on code from [Nx](https://github.com/Nuix/Nx) to present a settings dialog and progress dialog.  This JAR file is not included in the repository (although it is included in release downloads).  If you clone this repository, you will also want to obtain a copy of Nx.jar by either:
1. Building it from [the source](https://github.com/Nuix/Nx)
2. Downloading an already built JAR file from the [Nx releases](https://github.com/Nuix/Nx/releases)

Once you have a copy of Nx.jar, make sure to include it in the same directory as the script.
